2 ∈ A   (two is an element of set A)

A = ∅   (set A is empty)

|A| = 5   (the 'cardinality' i.e. size of a set. There are 5 elements in set A)

|∅| = 0   (the cardinality of the empty set is 0)

vertical bar can also = absolute value = the distance a number is from zero. 

|-1| = 1 while |3.1| = 3.1. A definition of the set of real numbers between -1 and 1 = B = {x : |x| < 1 ^ x is a real number}

A ∩ B     (the intersection of set A and set B) (can also be noted by "circumflex agent" which looks like a "caret" ^)

A ∩ B = {X: X ∈ A AND X ∈ B}  (satisfies or meets conditions or "such that") 
(X is in the intersection of sets A & B if X is an element of A and X is an element of B)

: or | (colon or pipe means 'such that')

f:x↦y means f is a function that takes the value x to the value y. (Think of a function as an operation that takes 
objects from one set and maps them to another set)

A ∪ B     (the union of set A or set B) (all the elements in set A or B or both)

A ∪ B  = {X: X ∈ A  OR X ∈ B} 

<=> means "if and only if e.g. A < b <=> b > A
   
<< means "much, much less than"

[2, 4] = {x ∈ ℝ:   2 ≤ x ≤ 4}  (square bracket means "closed interval")
(closed interval 2-4 where x is an element of the real numbers (ℝ) such that 2 is less than or equal to X and X is less than or equal to 4)

(2, 4) = {x ∈ ℝ:   2 < x < 4}  (round bracket means "open interval")
(open interval 2-4 where x is an element of the real numbers (ℝ) such that 2 is less than but not equal to X and X is less than but not equal to 4)

(2, 4] = {x ∈ ℝ:   2 < x < 4}  (one round bracket & one square bracket means "half open interval")
(half open interval 2-4 where x is an element of the real numbers (ℝ) such that 2 is less than but not equal to X and X is less than or equal to 4)

𝜇 ("mu" represents the mean value)

m Slope is often denoted by the letter m (m stands for multiple? e.g. Y is a multiple of x)

A popular form of a straight line is y= mx + c (this is called the slope-intercept form). Here c which is the intercept because when x = 0, y = c. m is the gradient because it makes y a multiple of x.

The slope "m" of the line is m (slope) = y subscript 2 - y subscript 1 (the change in y, aka delta y of dy) divided by x subscript 2 - x subscript 1 (the change/delta in x, aka delta x or dx)

If the slope m of a line and a point (x1,y1) on the line are both known, then the equation of the line can be found using the point-slope formula: y - y subscript 1 = m (x - x subscript 1)

α = the learning rate (in gradient descent)

Variance describes how "spread out" elements of a set are. The mean (𝜇) = E(x), [i.e. the mean is the "expected value" of X]. 

Variance is the average difference between X**2 and the mean. 

Variation (σ) [aka Sigma] is calculated:

(Variation [sigma squared] = the mean of … the sum of the distances between x and the mean of the set … squared)

(Equation generated on hostmath.com \sigma_{(x)}{}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu_x)^2    \right])

Standard deviation =



Tilde "~" means "has a probability distribution of". Picking from 2 boxes… P(A) = P(~A) = 1/2. (The probability of A occurring equals the probability distribution of A equals one of two)
